            <article>I was born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia. I consider myself an energetic and positive person with a bubbly personality. 
           I can usually make anyone laugh even when I'm not trying. I'm a black feminist and I believe that everybody should be treated 
           like a human no matter what. I'm also a concert connoiseur, foodie, and otaku. I am an experience and a picture doesn't do me any justice....except for the one below. 
           Which isn't even a real picture of me. And yet it captures me perfectly.
