    <h1>Alexis's Coding Challenges</h1>

    <h3>Array.diff</h3>

            <img src="coding images /array diff 2.png" height="800px" width="1100px">
        </figure>
        <p>For this challenge, I set the arrays. Then I thought I could set the elements of the arrays to be equal
            to each other. But I couldn't figure out how to continue. I tried to pseudocode a lot more for these challenges. 
        </p>

    <h3>Find the Odd Integer</h3>
        <figure>
            <img src="coding images /find the odd int1.png" height="800px" width="1100px">
            <img src="coding images /find the odd int2.png" height="800px" width="1100px">
        </figure>
        <p>
            In this challenge, I used the find method to pull out the values. Then, I used the length method to determine
            how many of the value was present in the array. Then, I was tried to use an if statement to for the odd amount of integers,
            but I didn't know what to return.  
        </p>
    <h3>Sort the Odd</h3>
        <figure>
            <img src= "coding images /sort the odd 1.png" height="800px" width="1100px">
            <img src= "coding images /sort the odd 2.png" height="800px" width="1100px">
        </figure>
        <p>
            For this challenge, I didn't know how to go about apporaching it. I tried to do an if statement
            that would return the odd numbers and then sort them. But I didn't know how to put them back into the original array. 

        <h3>Split Strings</h3>
        <figure>
            <img src= "coding images /split strings 1.png" height="800px" width="1100px">
            <img src= "coding images /split strings 2.png" height="800px" width="1100px">
        </figure>
        <p>
            For this challenge, I found out how to make the string come back in pairs. Honestly, this one seemed
            like it would work but it didn't. I think as I broke it down, I got confused on how to refer back to
            the original string. 
        </p>

        <h3>Your Order Please</h3>
        <figure>
            <img src= "coding images /your order please 1.png" height="800px" width="1100px">
            <img src= "coding images /your order please 2.png" height="800px" width="1100px">
        </figure>
        <p>
            For this challenge, I started by making a string that contained numbers in every word. Then,
            I extracted the numbers and sorted them. I was able to sort them in the correct order but 
            I couldn't think of a way to keep th numbers within the strings/words.
