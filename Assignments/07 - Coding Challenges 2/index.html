    <h1>Alexis's Coding Challenges</h1>

    <h3>Name Array</h3>
        <figure>
            <img src="coding images/code war name array problem.png" height="800px" width="1100px">
            <img src="coding images/code war name array attempt.png" height="800px" width="1100px">
        </figure>
        <p>For this challenge, I first started by trying to understand the conditions that were needed.
            I thought that the number of values in the area were significant to the response. Thus, I used the 
            names.length method and the while loop. However, nothing I tried seemed to work.

    <h3>High and Low</h3>
        <figure>
            <img src="coding images/code war high and low math problem.png" height="800px" width="1100px">
            <img src="coding images/code war high and low math attempt.png" height="800px" width="1100px">
        </figure>
        <p>
            I thought this challenge would be pretty simple, but I guess I'm lost. I used the 
            math.min and math.max methods s othat I could return the highest adn lowest numbers. 
            For some reason, it kept returning NaN even though I declared the numbers variable. I didn't 
            understand why. 
        </p>
    <h3>Bus</h3>
        <figure>
            <img src= "coding images/code war bus array problem.png" height="800px" width="1100px">
            <img src= "coding images/code war bus array attempt.png" height="800px" width="1100px">
        </figure>
        <p>
            For this challenge, I realized that all I needed to do was add all of the first numbers together
            and subtract the second numbers. I used a for loop to add all of the values together, but once again 
            it didn't work.
