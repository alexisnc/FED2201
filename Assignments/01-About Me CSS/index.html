        <h1 id="About">ABOUT</h1>
            <article style="color:purple">I was born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia. I consider myself an energetic and positive person with a bubbly personality. 
           I can usually make anyone laugh even when I'm not trying. I'm a black feminist and I believe that everybody should be treated 
           like a human no matter what. I'm also a concert connoiseur, foodie, and otaku. I am an experience and a picture doesn't do me any justice....except for the one below. 
           Which isn't even a real picture of me. And yet it captures me perfectly.

                <h3><li>Concerts</li></h3>             
                    <article>I go to concerts and music festivals on a regular basis. 
                    I feel like Atlanta is a great place for concerts because the city has so many small venues where you can go to see artists at reasonable prices. The venues are more intimate than stadium concerts.
                     The venues that I frequent inlcude: The Masquerade, Center Stage, Variety Playhouse, The Tabernacle, and Aisle 5. 
                    <br><br> Some of the music festivals I have attended are The Red Bull Music Festival, Music Midtown, and Afropunk. Afropunk is my favorite festival because there are so many alternative black people with unique styles
                    and I feel like I can be myself there. On the other hand, I probably won't return to Music Midtown because Piedmont Park is way too big and I didn't like enough of the artists to justify the cost. 
                    <br><br>My favorite genres are R&B and Pop and rap by women. Doja Cat, BbyMutha, Yung Baby Tate, and Junglepussy are some of the artists I enjoy. The Weeknd is one of my favorite artists as well.

                    <article>
                    I love food. I love 
                    to try new restaurants. If I go to a restaurant I always try to order a dessert with my meal. I don't really drink so I like to think that money is going towards the dessert. Sometimes I pretend 
                    I'm on this Korean show called <i>Let's Eat</i> and I savor every bite. The show just films people eating and makes it dramatic. <br><br>
                    Although I love food, I'm still a picky eater. I've been trying to eat the food the way chefs prepare it so that I can experience the true taste. But I still hate onions.

                <h3><li>Anime</li></h3>
                    <article>
                    In the <i>About</i> section, I mentioned that I was an otaku. An otaku is essentially someone that loves anime. Nowadays people refer to them as weebs, but I'm OG and prefer otaku. 
                    My favorite anime are Inuyasha, Nichijou, and Marmalade Boy. Subs are superior to dubs in my opinion. 
                    However, lately I've been watching dubs and some of them aren't that bad. But then again some of them are atrocious. Therefore, subs will remain superior.
